# Astro_Dating_Project
Android-based mobile phone application.
Created an Astro-Dating app based on the popular 12 solar sign Zodiac used in Western astrology that suggests to the 
User potential dates based on Astrological sun sign and sun element compatibility as determined by date of birth using 
Nexus 6P mobile phone (both emulated and actual) using API 23: Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), Firebase, and Android Studio. 
Wrote project proposal, Use cases, Application System design (Front End and Backend), UI Mockups, Features List, and Test Plan.
